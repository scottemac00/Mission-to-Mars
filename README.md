# Mission-to-Mars
In this challenge I collected, organized, analyzed, and visualized website data about Mars weather for future manned and unmanned missions. 

Using Jupyter Notebook, Python Pandas, Chrome DevTools, Beautiful Soup, and Splinter I was scraped data from the web, cleaned it, and made it presentable via a Pandas DataFrame in [Deliverable 1](part_1_mars_news.ipynb) and exported the data to a [JSON File](Data/mars_news.json). 

The analysis at the end of [Deliverable 2](part_2_mars_weather.ipynb) highlights how data scraped from the web can be sorted, filtered, and displayed to support future plans for space travel and Mars surface and orbital activities. You may find the exported data in the Resources Folder [here](Resources/mars_data.csv).
